I have a screen recorder app written in Python using tkinter. Do not change any of my logic or code structure â€” just update the UI only, specifically inside the setup_ui() method.

âœ… My goals:

Make the UI look modern, dark-themed, and sleek.

Use ttk.Combobox instead of OptionMenu.

Add better spacing, padding, and fonts (like Segoe UI).

Make buttons flat and colored properly:

Area button â†’ dark gray

Start button â†’ green

Stop button â†’ red

Exit button â†’ dark gray

Keep all my button names, variables, and logic unchanged.

Only modify the setup_ui() function. Nothing else.

ðŸ”´ Do not delete or change any other code (e.g. the screen recorder logic, button functions, class structure, etc.).

âœ… Optional (if possible): Add slightly rounded button corners and hover effect using ttk.Style.
