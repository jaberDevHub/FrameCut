feat: Improve UI and fix recording freeze issue

This commit addresses the following:
- Updates the UI to a modern, dark-themed look with improved spacing, padding, and fonts (Segoe UI).
- Replaces `ttk.OptionMenu` with `ttk.Combobox` for resolution and FPS selection.
- Implements flat, colored buttons with hover effects as per the design specifications.
- Fixes the application freezing issue after stopping a recording by offloading video post-processing to a separate thread.
- Ensures all frames are processed before the recording thread exits.
